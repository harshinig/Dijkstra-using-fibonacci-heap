Dijkstra-using-fibonacci-heap
=============================
The Fibonacci Heap scheme gives a better average performance over simple scheme when implementing the Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm. For sparse graphs, the improvement is significant as number of edges is less. For dense graphs , the performance of Fibonacci heap degrades to O(n^2) and is similar to the simple scheme.
